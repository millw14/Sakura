# 桜 Sakura

**読む。集める。所有する。**

*Read. Collect. Own.*

---

A manga platform that lives on **Solana** — because manga deserves more than a tab you close and forget.

## 🌸 what is this?

Sakura is a love letter to manga readers who want something *different*.

Instead of ads, tracking, and chapters that disappear — Sakura gives you a clean, beautiful reading experience with a twist: **weekly passes as NFTs on Solana**. One pass, one week, unlimited reading.

No accounts. No emails. Just your wallet and your manga.

<br>

## ✨ the vibe

- 🇯🇵 **Bilingual UI** — Japanese + English throughout, because aesthetics matter
- 📖 **Vertical scroll reader** — the way manga was meant to be read on screens
- 🎴 **Weekly Pass** — 1 USDC gets you a week of unlimited chapters, minted as an NFT you actually own
- 🔍 **Browse & search** — filter by genre, search by title, find your next obsession
- 🌙 **Dark mode** — obviously. your eyes deserve it

<br>

## 💭 the dream

The big idea is simple: *what if reading manga felt like it belonged in web3?*

Not in a loud, "gm ser" kind of way — but quietly. Elegantly. A platform where owning your access pass actually means something, where the reading experience is gorgeous, and where manga fans feel at home.

Sakura is still growing. More series, more features, more petals. 🌸
